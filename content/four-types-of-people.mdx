When discussing social behavior, it's useful to consider how people make decisions and what influences their actions. There are several types of people that can be identified based on how they act in social situations and whether or not they are influenced by others.

| Person | Act on wants | Affected by others |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genuine | yes | no |
| Over-thinker | no | no |
| Poser | yes | yes |
| Dead fish | no | yes |

### **Genuine**

People who are genuine in their actions make decisions based on their own beliefs and desires, without being swayed by the opinions or expectations of others. They are not concerned with how they will be perceived by others and simply act on their own wants.

### **Over-thinker**

Over-thinkers, on the other hand, tend to base their actions on what they believe is expected of them, rather than on their own desires. They may be afraid of how they will be perceived if they act on their own wants, so they choose to follow the norm rather than act on their own desires.

### **Poser**

Posers are similar to genuine people in that they act on their own wants. However, their motivation is driven by the desire to be perceived a certain way by others. They may put their own desires aside in order to conform to what is accepted by the general public.

### **Dead fish**

Dead fish are those who go along with whatever is happening or whatever others want, without taking an active role in deciding their own actions. They may not necessarily be influenced by others' opinions, but they also don't have strong convictions of their own and may come across as passive or uninvolved in social situations. These categories are not necessarily fixed or mutually exclusive, and individuals may exhibit qualities of more than one type in different situations.

It's important to recognize that these categories are not fixed and that individuals may exhibit qualities of different types in different situations. It's also worth considering that these categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and a person may exhibit qualities of more than one type in different situations.

Ultimately, it's important to be aware of how our own actions and decisions are influenced by others, as well as to consider the motivations behind the actions of those around us. By understanding these different types of behavior, we can gain insight into our own actions and the actions of others, and work towards making decisions that are authentic and true to ourselves.

In conclusion, people exhibit different types of behavior in social situations based on whether or not they are influenced by others and whether they act on their own wants. Understanding these different types of behavior can help us gain insight into our own actions and the actions of others, and work towards making authentic and genuine decisions.

It's worth noting that the categories and descriptions of social behavior outlined in this article are not based on empirical research or established psychological theories. They are intended to provide a general framework for considering how people make decisions and act in social situations, but should not be taken as definitive or scientifically rigorous.

That being said, there are several psychological theories and concepts that may be relevant to understanding social behavior and decision-making. For example, the concept of self-esteem, which refers to an individual's overall sense of self-worth, has been found to influence how people make decisions and interact with others (Coopersmith, 1967). In addition, the concept of social comparison, which refers to the process of evaluating one's own abilities and opinions by comparing oneself to others, has been found to play a role in social decision-making and behavior (Festinger, 1954).

In conclusion, it's important to consider the many factors that can influence social behavior and decision-making, including individual differences in self-esteem and the influence of social comparison processes. While the categories outlined in this article provide a useful framework for thinking about social behavior, it's important to keep in mind that they are not based on scientific research and should not be taken as definitive.
